## Roughly 2004 – 2010

### Style: Increased Site Complexity, Tons of Browsers to Support

### Working with: Robust DOM Manipulation, Early Single-Page Apps

> “we do stuff with the HTML you see on screen without requiring a browser refresh.”

### John Resig, jQuery’s creator


>When I originally created the library I wanted to scratch two personal itches: 1) To provide a simple interface for interacting with the DOM and 2) Reduce the number of cross-browser issues that exist during development.[2]

---

### Served Several painpoints
* Dealing with the DOM across multiple browsers
* AJAX, which allowed for asynchronous exchange of data with the server 
* Gmail Era
* Protype, Mootools

---

### New Problem 
> tens of thousands of lines of jQuery code were difficult to maintain and contained so much custom functionality that bringing new developers on board became challenging

---

## Roughly 2010 - 2014
### Style: DHTML Overload, Large-Scale Data Manipulation, Speed
### Working with: MVC-like frameworks, Bi-Directional Data Flow, DOM “Automagic”

---

### Additions
* Chrome - 2008
* V8 Engine
  * Node.js

---
### The idea
>JavaScript frameworks needed to become more like those that already existed for back-end languages like C++, PHP, Ruby, and others.

---
## Enter
* **Backbone:**  to split code up into data models, collections of functions with which to manipulate that data, and views with which to display it.

---
### And More
* **AngularJS** bi-direction data flow, AngularJS allowed developers to build apps that reflected changes in data on both the server and client side.

```HTML
<userlist ng-repeat="user in $user.list"></userlist>
```

---

##  Roughly 2014 – Present
### Style: Speed, Increased App Complexity, Reliability
### Working with: Virtual DOM, Single Direction Data Flow, Types, Testing

---

## Tooling

* Bunders
* Task Runners
